The le() comparison requires \"breaking\" of the representation into its left and right. The part() routine provides the left and right parts without knowing the numeric value of the representation as a fraction. Implied but not highlighted here is a binary representation of surreal numbers which when incremented as standard binary matches their birth order.\n",
