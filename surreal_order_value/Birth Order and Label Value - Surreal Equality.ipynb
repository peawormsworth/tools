    "The equations say something about how surreal numbers can be stored and evaluated in binary. The storage appears to be a 2's compliment with a 1 bit attached to the end and the decimal place just after the left most bit. For example, \"2n\" instructs the binary value to be shifted left by one bit. \"2n+1\" means to shift left and then make the new bit on the right be a \"1\". 2^d-1 is one less than the size of a binary register required to contain at least that number. 2^d is the \"size\" of the number when written in binary. Dividing by powers of 2 have the effect of shifting the decimal place in binary. Just as dividing by 10's shifts the decimal in Decimal notation. So we can see that the left side of the equation is shifting, adding a 1 to the end and putting the decimal point one behind the front of its binary representation of its birth order number.\n",
