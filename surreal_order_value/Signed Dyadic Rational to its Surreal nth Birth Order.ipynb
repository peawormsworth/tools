    "The formulas provide an equality between Surreal number birth order and their numeric label.\n",
    "Honestly... the equality holds under analytic tests and appears logical. However, I can not get from one side to the other of this equation without precalculating or determining the values in another manner which uses a conditional loop. This equality is close and perhaps someone can show me what is missing here.\n",
    "The last test (as I write this) fails to display the proper surreal birth number. That is because I can not know the register size of the number used to hold the dyadic in a sinary representation without already knowing the surreal order number. I think. I'm not sure if this could be done."
