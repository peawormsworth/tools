It also allows for 4 dimensional numbers having four single dimensional numbers inside. Then 8, 16, 32 etc numbers all within one number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, we would use real numbers for this multidimensional code. Instead we put surreal numbers in as coefficients. But also we are going to add to our curset format to allow all of these numbers to be held in one representation. This means that our programs will see multi-dimensional numbers as single objects of uniform and minimal construction. This may provide efficiency, but also allow the format to be manipulated in hardware directly without outside intervention during the recursive processes normally required when performing binary calculations.\n",
